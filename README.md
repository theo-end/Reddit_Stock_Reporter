# Reddit_Stock_Reporter
This project allows users to look up and compare the most frequently discussed stock tickers between different reddit subreddits. The final tool will update daily and provide a list of the most discussed stocks by ticker mentions and upvotes. Currently, the ticker parsing code is complete but the tool's reporting webpage and calculation functions are a work in progress.
